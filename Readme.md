This project is for the tutorial of prisma. 

I've followed this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebA5J-rlwg which I think is the best so far for the prisma guides.


### Notes based on the tutorial ###

# To use postresql datasource: npm prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql
# Needs to have a postresql empty db
# Install Prisma Extenstion to have a better experience developing prisma projects
# If not yet applied, go to Preferences>Settings
# Then on the upper-right, click the Open Settings(JSON)
# And the copy this prisma config
